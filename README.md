## Mantra: making the next generation apps, today.

### Introduction

[Meteor](http://www.meteor.com), quoting their slogan, is *the fastest way to build JavaScript apps*.

In a world where programming languages, tools and web components inspired on JavaScript are growing meanwhile we read this page, rely on a flexible platform as Meteor can give us the possibility to develop apps in easy way following this evolution.

Looking for great frameworks to pair with Meteor, I've found often three answers: Blaze (already included with Meteor), React and Angular 2.

With my previous working experience with AngularJS, Angular 2 could be obvious.

Anyway, I've put aside my love for Angular's philosophy and I have spent few weeks comparing benefits, measuring the work the community behind the frameworks, the opportunity of integration with third party libraries (Polymer, Bootstrap 4, ...) and figure out the vision and future of each one.

*More docs coming soon, stay tuned...*
