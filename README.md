## Mantra: making the next generation apps, today.

Mantra (**M**eteor, **A**ngular2, **N**grx, **T**ypeScript, **R**xjs, **A**nd) born to fuse heterogeneous concepts and frameworks making a new platform with good practices and utils to start a new
 (or migrate) project with Angular2 and Meteor.

### Introduction

[Meteor](http://www.meteor.com), quoting their slogan, is *the fastest way to build JavaScript apps*.

In a world where programming languages, tools and web components inspired on JavaScript are growing meanwhile we read this page, rely on a flexible platform as Meteor can give us the possibility to
 develop apps in easy way following this evolution.

Looking frameworks for client-side development, I've found more alternatives but I had decided to pay attention on those better compatible with Meteor: **Blaze** (bundled with Meteor), **React** 
and **Angular 2**.

With my previous working experience with AngularJS, Angular 2 could be obvious.

Anyway, I've put aside my love for Angular's philosophy and I have spent few weeks on compare:
1. Compatibility with Meteor without strong dependency (if we want migrate client-side on another place, we need to rewrite it from scratch?)
2. Features offer
3. MVC pattern coverage
4. Third-party libraries compatibility
5. Community beside frameworks (in term of issues resolved, release average and so on, you know)
6. Documentation
7. Roadmap and vision (without consult an astrologist, I promise :P)

Blaze, as we expect, cover 100% the _point 1_ for compatibility but is 100% dependent on Meteor, so even is valid framework and have amazing features combined into I can't consider it on my 
client-side app.

Between React (and Redux) and Angular 2 was been heavy decision. Both have nice features and coverage more than 70% of my need.
Anyway, in my opinion, if React (and Redux) given a new way to build frontend projects, Angular 2 has learned from its mistakes (like '$scope', nightmare for most developers :P) and *reacted*
 taking best of concepts from its "competitor" made a great framework from scratch.

More people also have noticed this, including Meteor's community, and they have started amazing projects likes [Angular-Meteor](https://www.angular-meteor.com/) and [Ngrx](https://github.com/ngrx) 
for example.

Thanks of them, today we can build frontend apps more robust, flexible, cross-platform with a powerful architecture. 

In this scenario we can ask: *Why Mantra?*. The answer is: I have no idea :P.

Okay, I'm serious now. All of kinds are fantastic, we can make small or enterprise projects driven by our needs and not only in one-way defined by a specific framework but (there is ever a *but*, 
damn) how much cost that revolution?
  
Any seasoned developer after an initial "wow" start to think at:
- Learning curve
- Knowledge of programming language 
- Architecture design
- How to persuade the boss to take him (and teammates) some time to migrate project before new implementations (with yesterday as due date) 
- Maintenance
- Testing
- Code styling (okay, that is for nerd)
- Integration  

Now if you're not scared of this, we can pass to explain how Mantra can help us to make them less painful.
